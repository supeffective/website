## About the creator

I'm Javier, a Spanish Software Engineer (Senior Backend Developer and future Data Scientist) based in Berlin who, among
other many things, loves Pokémon and likes to learn game development as a hobby as well.

I've been playing Pokémon since Red and Blue and after all these years I am still as passionate about it as always,
especially before the release of a new generation when everyone is so hyped.

I created this website because I want to build a great community of Pokémon fans, have a Pokémon blog with news that I
consider essential, and build tools that will make our lives easier as Pokémon trainers, either if you play solo or
competitively. The Living Dex tracker is just the start of all I want to do. Creating this site, I also learned a lot
about modern frontend development, which makes my journey as an engineer even greater.

> I have a blog on Hashnode that I update when I have time, where I share my experiences, my progress, tips, and
> tutorials about web and game development. You find me on:

- Personal site: [itsjavi.com](https://itsjavi.com)
- Github (my open source contributions): [github.com/itsjavi](https://github.com/itsjavi)
- Itch.io (my gaming assets): [route1rodent](https://route1rodent.itch.io)
- Linkedin (professional profile, available for hiring): [linkedin.com/in/itsjavi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itsjavi/)
- Hashnode: [hashnode.com/@itsjavi](https://hashnode.com/@itsjavi)
